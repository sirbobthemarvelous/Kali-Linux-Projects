# Setting Up the VirtualBox
First you should download VirtualBox
Then Download the ISO file (installer) appropriate for your machine
Then download the prepackaged VM file (because otherwise you'd have to spend a lot of time setting up the credentials and other details)
but If you do want to set up the details, remmeber the credentials aren't just kali/kali
